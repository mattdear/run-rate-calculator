# run_rate_calculator

## About
The cricket run rate calculator is made using python. Version 1.6.2 can be used for the first innings and second innings of a game however, it cannot be used for multi-day game formats. Once each calculation is completed you will be asked if you would like to update the run rate, you will then be asked for the required information and the calculation will be reapeated. Once the innings is completed respond 'n' to the update request and the application will close. If you would then like to use it for the second innings you will need to run the program again. 

## How to run
1. Clone this repository https://github.com/mattdear/run_rate_calculator.git
2. Using the BASH or CMD to move to the directory that you have cloned the repository to.
3. Type ./runRate.py in BASH or in CMD to start the application.
4. To calculate the run rate again you will need to repeat step 3.
