# run_rate_calculator

## About
This is a cricket run rate calculator made in python. Version 1.0 can only be used once the first innings is completed. You will have to enter all information every time you want to update the required run rate. I have plans to extend the application with more features in the future.  

## How to run
1. Clone this repository https://github.com/mattdear/run_rate_calculator.git
2. Using the BASH or CMD to move to the directory that you have cloned the repository to.
3. Type ./runRate.py in BASH or in CMD to start the application.
4. To calculate the run rate again you will need to repeat step 3.
