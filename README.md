# run_rate_calculator

This run rate calculator is made using python. Version 1.6.2 can be used for the first and second innings of a cricket game however, it cannot be used for multi-day game formats. Once each calculation is completed you will be asked if you would like to update the run rate, you will then be asked for the current run total and the calculation will be reapeated. Once the first innings is completed respond 'n' to the update request and the application will close. If you would then like to use it for the second innings you will need to run the program again and say 'n' to First innings.
